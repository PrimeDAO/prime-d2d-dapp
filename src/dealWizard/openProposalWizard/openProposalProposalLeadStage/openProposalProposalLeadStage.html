          Select “keep admin rights” if you would like to the proposal lead to keep the rights to editing, discussion, funding initiation and token swap execution for all incoming offers to collaborate.

          We suggest transferring your admin rights if you anticipate a lot of proposals, and won’t have time to manage all of them.
