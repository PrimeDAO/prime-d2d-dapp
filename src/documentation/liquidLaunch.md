### Liquid Launch

*Liquid Launches are currently in development and are expected to go live in September 2021. If you're interested in hosting a Liquid Launch on Prime Launch, it's already possible to pre-register and request more information via **this form**.* 

A Liquid Launch is a public token offering that works by attempting to bootstrap the liquidity of a new token. Initially coined Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools, Liquid Launches utilize Balancer V2 to facilitate fair and efficient environments for distributing tokens. The mechanism has been utilized dozens of times over the past year with <a href="">promising results.</a>https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82) 

In the back end, a **Liquid Launch** is an adjustable Balancer V2 pool designed for initial distribution and price discovery of a new asset. The pool will generally start with a high weight of project tokens (e.g. 95%) and a small weight of funding tokens (e.g. 5% DAI). During the Liquid Launch, often 2 to 3 days, the pool weights are continuously rebalanced toward the funding token, which leads project token price to slowly decline. Contributors can participate at their preferred price point, while bots and arbitrageurs do not benefit from frontrunning (as buying early generally leads to overpaying).

The result is a fair and accessible token launch shown to effectively discover the market price of an asset and raise funds for the project team, without requiring prohibitive initial capital or enabling problematic frontrunning. 

**Liquid Launch Benefits** 

- ***decentralized*** — decentralized infrastructure, run by a DAO
- ***capital-efficient*** — LBPs help distribute more tokens at efficient price points with less initial capital
- ***fair*** — LBPs constant downward price pressure dis-incentivizes front-running and large buys from whales, giving better opportunities to your intended contributors
- ***multi-use*** — configure your launch to segue directly into another use-case (e.g to serve as a 50/50 AMM after the initial sale)
- ***multi-asset*** — smart order routing means that users can trade any token in exchange for the new one at the price of higher slippage (using Balancer on the back end)
