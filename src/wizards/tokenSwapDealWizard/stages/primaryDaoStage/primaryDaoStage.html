        Representatives are whitelisted accounts that can:
        <br /><br />
        <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
          <li>
            cast a vote on the deal, either to accept or reject it
          </li>
          <li>
            fund the deal, as well as withdraw and claim tokens.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        In an Open Deal anyone can engage in a discussion.
        <br /><br />
        Representatives are defined by the Primary DAO first and by the Partner DAO later as part of an offer.
        <br /><br />
        A deal gets accepted if more than half of the representatives of involved DAO's vote agree.
        <br /><br />
        Please put the address of the Proposal Lead if they are part of the Primary DAO, and wish to partake in the voting process.
