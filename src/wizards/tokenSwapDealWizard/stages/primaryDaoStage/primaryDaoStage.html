            cast a vote on the deal, either to accept or reject it

          In a Partnered Deal, Representatives are the only ones that can discuss the clauses of a deal.

          In an Open Proposal anyone can engage in a discussion.
        </template>
        <br/><br/>
        Representatives are defined by the Primary DAO first and by the Partner DAO later as part of an offer.
        <br/><br/>
        A deal gets accepted if more than half of the representatives of involved DAO's vote agree.
        <br/><br/>
        Note that the Proposal Lead is not allowed to deposit funds from the UI, nor to partake in the voting process
        unless their address is also listed as Representative, so if you want to also fund or cast votes from the
        Proposal Lead address please add it here as a Representative too.
