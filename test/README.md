# E2E (Cypress)
[Cypress Readme](/cypress/README.md)

## Difference of unit testing and E2E
- Unit: Test one part of a component/code in isolation (--> "a unit")
  - We are using Jest (alternatives: Jasmine, Mocha)
- E2E: Test many components/code interacting (--> End to End)
  - We are using Cypress (alternatives: Playwright, others)
